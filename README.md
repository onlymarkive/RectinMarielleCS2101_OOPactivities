I am **Marielle J. Rectin**, a 2nd Year Computer Science student at **Batangas State University - The National Engineering University, Alangilan Campus**. This repository reflects my journey and growth in the field of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It includes my hands-on activities, exercises, and projects that demonstrate the application of OOP principles in solving real-world problems.

## üìö About the Repository  
Welcome to my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) repository!  
This repository showcases my hands-on Java activities and projects for the CS 211 course. These activities were crafted to strengthen my understanding of key OOP principles, including:  

- **Encapsulation**: Protecting and bundling data with relevant methods.  
- **Inheritance**: Establishing relationships between classes to promote code reusability.  
- **Polymorphism**: Enabling objects to take on multiple forms.  
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on relevant details.
